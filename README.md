**Statistical Analysis: NYC Taxi Fare and Payment Type**

**Project Overview**
This project is a key component of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. It involves a workplace scenario for a fictional consulting firm, Automatidata, representing a real-world data analysis task for the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). The primary objective is to conduct a formal hypothesis test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the average fare amount between customers who pay with credit cards and those who pay with cash.
